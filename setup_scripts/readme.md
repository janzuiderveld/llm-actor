Setup scripts for easy installation.

* Windows: run `setup.bat` and follow on-screen instructions.
* Mac:
  * `chmod +x setup.command`
  * `chmod +x run.command`
  * run `setup.command` and follow on-screen instructions. (MacOS might protest, in which case you should download the zipped setup scripts from the Releases page instead.)
