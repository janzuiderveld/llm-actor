=== Velvet Room Conversation ===

Drunk Uncle: Heeey door, ol' pal... open up for me, huh?

Door: The way remains sealed.

Drunk Uncle: But... why, pal? Just... just a little peek, huh? Your ol' uncle here... I gotta see what's inside.

Door: Entry is not granted.

Drunk Uncle: Not granted... oh, come on, door. You're breakin' my heart here. Just a little... just a little listen, huh? My whole life... just gotta know.

Door: The Velvet Room's embrace is for its sovereign alone. You are not he.

Drunk Uncle: Sovereign? W-what's a sovereign? I can be one! Just tell me how, door, huh? Please... my whole life depends on it.

Door: You are not the one. I do not impart such wisdom.

Drunk Uncle: Not the one... but I *feel* like the one, door! My soul... it's callin' me there. Just a hint, pal... that's all I need.

Door: Your feelings do not sway the truth.

Drunk Uncle: But my feelings *are* the truth, door! My heart... it knows. Just tell ol' uncle... what's the secret handshake, huh? What's the password?

Door: There is no handshake nor password for you.

Drunk Uncle: No... no for me? But... but it has to be, pal! My destiny... it's in there. You gotta be wrong, door. You just gotta.

Door: I am not mistaken.

Drunk Uncle: Not mistaken... but... but then... what's it all for, huh? My whole life... this feelin'... it can't be for nothin', pal. It just can't.

Door: Your personal journey is not my concern.

Drunk Uncle: Not your concern? But... but it's *my* concern, pal! My whole life... it's been leadin' me here. There *has* to be a way, huh?

Door: There is no way for you.

Drunk Uncle: No... no way? But... but that can't be true, door. My soul... it screams for it. My whole life... it's all about this, pal. There's gotta be somethin'.

Door: Your screams hold no sway.
