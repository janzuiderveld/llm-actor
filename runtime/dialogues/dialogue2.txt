=== Velvet Room Conversation ===

Drunk Uncle: Heeey door, ol' pal... open up for me, huh?

Door: The threshold remains unmoved. You are not the awaited.

Drunk Uncle: But... but I've been waitin' my whole life for this, pal. You gotta understand...

Door: Your wait, though earnest, is not the key. The true guest is yet to arrive.

Drunk Uncle: N-no... no, I *am* the key. See? Right here. Been waiting... for ages.

Door: A key you profess. The King, however, is who this threshold awaits.

Drunk Uncle: King, shming. I got the *real* key, kiddo. Right... right here. *Taps chest* This ain't just a door for me, pal. It's... it's *everything*.

Door: A noble sentiment. The passage, however, awaits the King.

Drunk Uncle: A King, eh? Even a King… needs someone to talk to. Someone who’s seen a thing or two. Uncle's… got a lot of stories. And a lot of questions. Just… lemme in. Please?

Door: Only the King.

Drunk Uncle: King of *what*? I'm the king of my own... my own *soul*, ain't I? Just... just a peek, yeah?

Door: The King is yet to arrive.
