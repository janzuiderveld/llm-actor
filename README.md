# llm-actor

This project packages a thin Python CLI around [Pipecat](https://docs.pipecat.ai/) to deliver a real-time audio loop using Deepgram Flux speech-to-text, Gemini 2.5 Flash streaming text generation, and Deepgram Aura-2 text-to-speech. External automation hooks are exposed via append-only files under `runtime/`.

## Features

* Deepgram Flux STT → Gemini 2.5 Flash → Deepgram Aura-2 TTS pipeline, fully streaming.
* File-based automation using append-only `runtime/inbox.txt`, `runtime/actions.txt`, and `runtime/params_inbox.ndjson`.
* Turn-level transcript and event logging per session.
* Runtime parameter application between turns (LLM, STT, TTS, history operations).

## Prerequisites

* [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer (3.11 recommended as it's the version that this is tested on).
* [Deepgram](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/deepgram-api-overview) and [Google API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) credentials with access to Flux STT, Aura-2 TTS, and Gemini 2.5 Flash.
* System audio devices accessible to PortAudio (used by Pipecat's local audio transport).
  * macOS: `brew install portaudio`
  * Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install portaudio19-dev`
  * Windows: the bundled `sounddevice` wheel ships PortAudio automatically. However, Windows users need to install [ffmpeg](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows) for audio playback.

## Quickstart

Projects provide self-contained recipes that wrap the core audio loop, refresh runtime state, and launch any helper daemons you need alongside the agent. The repository ships with an **Exclusive Door** experience that demonstrates how to run the full pipeline with custom automation.

Follow these steps to run the door project end-to-end:

1. **Set up the environment**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/janzuiderveld/llm-actor
   cd llm_actor
   python -m venv .venv # make sure to use python3.10+ (use python -V to check)
   # if you get "command not found: python" type python3 instead of python
   source .venv/bin/activate # for Mac or Linux
   # .venv\Scripts\activate # for Windows
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip 
   pip install -e .
   ```

   Reactivate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) whenever you open a new terminal for this project.

2. **Add credentials and defaults**

   (Mac)
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   (Windows)
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

   Open `.env` in your editor and fill in `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, and any optional defaults (LLM, STT, voice) you want to preload. Save the file before continuing.

4. **Launch the example project**

   ```bash
   python EXAMPLE_PROJECT/boot.py
   ```

   The boot script resets `runtime/`, seeds the persona, and starts the main audio loop together with the helper daemons. Stop everything with `Ctrl+C` when you are done.

When the project is running, a terminal window running `inbox_writer.py` prompts you to press Enter to simulate “someone approaches the door.” The action watcher listens for `<UNLOCK>` / `<LOCK>` directives given by the persona and keeps the persona aligned with the door state.

### Door Project Files

- `EXAMPLE_PROJECT/boot.py`: Coordinates startup, clears prior transcripts, seeds the locked persona, and spins up the helper processes. Adjust the `locked_config` and `unlocked_config` blocks to experiment with different prompts or voices.
- `EXAMPLE_PROJECT/action_watcher.py`: Monitors `runtime/actions.txt` for `<UNLOCK>` / `<LOCK>` cues, keeps `runtime/inbox.txt` tidy, and flips between the locked and unlocked personalities.
- `EXAMPLE_PROJECT/inbox_writer.py`: Provides a simple keyboard loop that appends “someone approaches the door” to `runtime/inbox.txt`, triggering a new turn whenever a visitor arrives.
- `runtime/actions.txt`: Append-only instruction log produced by the agent. External automations (such as the watcher) listen here for directives like `<UNLOCK>`.
- `runtime/inbox.txt`: Entry point for out-of-band events and user speech. The watcher uses it to queue prompts that walk the agent through the door state transitions.
- `runtime/params_inbox.ndjson`: Applies configuration tweaks between turns. The watcher writes persona swaps into this file when the door locks or unlocks.
- `runtime/conversations/<timestamp>/`: Holds transcripts and event logs for each session. Use it to inspect how the persona responded while you iterate on prompts.
- `EXAMPLE_PROJECT/assets/*.mp3`: The short door-open and door-close cues that play alongside persona changes. Swap them with your own audio to customize the ambience.


## Runtime Automation Reference

**`runtime/inbox.txt`**
- `P: <text>` — push a full user turn immediately.
- `A: <text>` — buffer supplemental text; multiple lines are joined with newlines and appended to the next user entry.

**`runtime/actions.txt`**
- Append-only log emitted by the agent (everything between <...> is added to this file. for example `<LOCK>` > `LOCK\n`). External services should tail this file and react to directives as they appear.

**`runtime/params_inbox.ndjson`**
- Processed between turns to adjust runtime behavior. Append any of the following operations one JSON object per line:

```bash
{"op":"history.reset"}
{"op":"history.append","role":"user","content":"Remember my name is Kai."}
{"op":"llm.set","model":"gemini-2.5-flash","temperature":0.6,"max_tokens":1024}
{"op":"llm.system","text":"You are a concise assistant."}
{"op":"stt.flux","eager_eot_threshold":0.5,"eot_threshold":0.85,"eot_timeout_ms":1500}
{"op":"tts.set","voice":"aura-2-thalia-en","encoding":"linear16","sample_rate":24000}
```

## Acoustic Echo Cancellation

- Install [Krisp](https://krisp.ai/download/) for system-level acoustic echo cancellation. This makes sure persona output does not leak into the microphone input.
- Set **Krisp Microphone** and **Krisp Speaker** as your input/output devices in `boot.py` or use the auto flag in the audio config.
NOTE: It is possible that sound output is crackling when using Krisp. If this happens, for now continue with headphones. Will do a universal fix in future update.

## Testing

The test harness expects valid API keys in your environment. Once configured, run:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Tests perform the following real API checks:

1. `tests/test_api_readiness.py`
   * Streams a short utterance through Deepgram Flux STT and validates a transcript.
   * Requests a 1-second sample from Deepgram Aura-2 TTS.
   * Streams a small prompt through Gemini 2.5 Flash and verifies tokens arrive.
2. `tests/test_full_pipeline.py`
   * Synthesizes test audio via Deepgram TTS and feeds it into the Pipecat pipeline.
   * Logs turn-level latency markers including TTFRAP (time to first response audio packet).

If credentials are missing the tests skip with a clear message.

## Troubleshooting

* **Audio devices missing**: Ensure PortAudio is installed (see prerequisites) and run `python -m sounddevice` inside your virtualenv to confirm the runtime can enumerate devices.
* **429 / rate limits**: The tests and pipeline perform real API calls; adjust usage or upgrade account tiers if needed.
* **High latency**: Tune Flux EOT thresholds via `runtime/params_inbox.ndjson` to improve responsiveness.
